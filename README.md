# MakerRepo

A website where makers can publish projects. An initiative by the University of Ottawa's
[Centre for Entrepreneurship and Engineering Design (CEED)](https://engineering.uottawa.ca/CEED).

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/uOttawa-Makerspace/MakerSpaceRepo/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/uOttawa-Makerspace/MakerSpaceRepo/actions)

## New developer setup

You'll need Ruby via rbenv, PostgreSQL, and NodeJS via NVM to run the website locally.
Then you'll need the master encryption key `config/master.key` and a database backup (referred to as `msr-backup.bak` here) to have a proper local installation.

### Windows

Windows developers need to [install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) then follow the Linux-specific instructions below inside the WSL environment.

```powershell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu # Or any distro
```

**Note**: When cloning the repository make sure to not clone it within the `/mnt` directory, as this directory is shared with windows and may cause performance issues.

### macOS

macOS developers need to install [Homebrew if not already installed](https://brew.sh/). Homebrew is a macOS package manager, similar to `apt` or `pacman`. It also manages services, used to start PostgreSQL. To start the database after installation, run `brew services start postgresql`

### General instructions

1. Install external dependencies and libraries.
   For macOS:

   ```bash
   brew install postgresql@17 libpq imagemagick
   brew services start postgresql
   ```

   For Linux:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install postgresql libpq-dev imagemagick
   sudo systemctl enable postgresql --now
   ```

2. Clone and install required ruby version

   **IMPORTANT:** [Make sure that you have all ruby-build requirements present](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build/wiki#suggested-build-environment), before starting Ruby compilation, or else you'll get an error after a long wait. Note that the requirements are different for each system.

   ```bash
   # Install rbenv
   curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
   # Clone repository using SSH if you're planning to make commits
   git clone ssh://git@github.com:uOttawa-Makerspace/MakerSpaceRepo.git
   cd ./Install
   # MakerSpaceRepo version in .ruby-version
   rbenv install
   # Install ruby dependencies
   bundler install
   # Install foreman
   gem install foreman
   ```

3. [Install NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), Node, then Yarn.
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
   nvm install 18 --lts
   nvm use 18
   npm install -g yarn
   yarn install
   ```
4. Make SAML certificates
   ```bash
   mkdir certs
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/saml.key -out certs/saml.crt -days 365 -nodes
   ```
5. Move the master credentials key into config

   ```bash
   mv ~/Downloads/master.key config/master.key
   ```

6. Change the default PostgreSQL port from 5432 to 5433. Start PostgreSQL and access a PostgreSQL shell. When inside nano, press `Ctrl-W` to start search.

   ```bash
   # Find the postgres config file and open in nano
   sudo nano $(sudo -u postgres -i psql -c 'SHOW config_file' | sed -n '3p')
   sudo systemctl restart postgresql
   psql -U postgres
   # or
   sudo -u postgres -i psql
   ```

   Set the password for the `postgres` user to `postgres`. Then load a staging database backup

   ```SQL
   ALTER USER "postgres" WITH PASSWORD 'postgres';
   CREATE DATABASE makerspacerepo;
   \c makerspacerepo
   \i ./path/to/msr-backup.bak
   exit
   ```

7. Setup development and test databases
   ```bash
   rake db:setup
   RAILS_ENV=test rake db:setup
   ```
8. Run tests from the project root. If this doesn't immediately fail, you should have a functioning backend
   ```bash
   rake
   ```
9. Start the server
   ```bash
   foreman start -f Procfile.dev
   ```

Then visit http://localhost:3000 to view the home page locally.

**NOTE:** You'll receive a lot of AWS errors because you're accessing production images using development credentials.

## Deployment

Deployment is handled by Capistrano on Github Actions. Pushing to the staging branch deploys to staging server after tests pass. Pushing to the master branch deploys to the production server after tests pass.
