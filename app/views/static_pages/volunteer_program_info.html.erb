    <br>

    <p>
      There have been many changes to the volunteer program with comparison to previous years.
      The goal of the new program is for the volunteers to build their skills in either the Makerspace
      or Brunsfield by getting them to complete tasks generated by the space managers. These tasks
      will be available on Makerepo and the volunteers can sign up for them once they complete
      necessary training.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, the volunteers will have to complete two mandatory trainings, a 3D printing workshop
      and their basic training in the MTC. If they have done the training within the past year and have
      been actively using the spaces, they don’t need to repeat it. Once they have completed both of
      those, they will need to shadow for 6 hours in the Makerspace and 6 hours in Brunsfield.
    </p>

    <p>The goal of these shadowing shifts is to get the volunteers comfortable with the spaces by
      learning the vibes of the spaces and getting exposure to some of the other things that can be
      done. It’s important that volunteers hear some of the questions being asked by students to
      learn how to answer them and therefore learning more information about the spaces.</p>

    <p>Once the candidates have completed their trainings and shadowing, a staff member will accept
      them as a volunteer on Makerepo and they will gain access to the task list. The task list
      has various small project for the volunteers to accomplish on it with a suggested number of
      hours it will take to complete and then a corresponding amount of CC points they will get
      from completing the task. CC points are essentially translated into Makerstore gift cards.
      Students can use them to purchase things from the Makerstore or can use them to pay for
      their proficiency projects. Proficiency projects are the test project students can complete
      once they have completed a suggested number of hours building the skill of their choice and
      feel they are ready to move up to the next level.
      Upon successful completion of the proficiency project, they will receive a badge which will be
      visible on their Linkedin profile. They start at basic proficiency upon completing the workshop,
      and can move up all the way to Mastery.</p>

    <p>Volunteers will also have the opportunity to sign up for tasks on Makerepo such as “open hours
      in the Makerspace” and for specific events like Makercon. They can receive volunteer hours for
      doing these tasks.</p>

    <p>If people are interested in volunteering, tell them to reach out to me by email at
      and I will send them all the information they need. If there are
      previous volunteers, they still need to go through the required trainings and if they have
      questions about it tell them to email me and we can talk about their specific case. My goal is to
      have it as systematic as possible however there are always exceptions and I am going to do my
      best to accommodate within reason.</p>
