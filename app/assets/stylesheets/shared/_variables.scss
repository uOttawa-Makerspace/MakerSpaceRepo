// Sass variables are compiled away. They are imperative, meaning the value is
// copied and constant when used on a rule. Sass variables start with '$'
//
// CSS variables are not compiled away and are declarative, meaning when a
// variable is assigned all rules beneath the assignment receive the updated
// value. Another way to put it is, when a CSS variable changes the rulesets are
// recomputed and repainted. CSS variables start with '--'.
//
// Because CSS variables can hold strings, use #{} to evaluate sass variables.
// Look at the header.scss file for a simple demonstration.
//
// Additionally, bootstrap 5.3 doesn't seem to have a way to change theme
// colors, so you'd have to manually set primary and secondary RGB colors
// yourself. https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/37976
